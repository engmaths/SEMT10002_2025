# robot simulation

'''
## Task

Write a program that simulates a robot driving the lawnmower search pattern from Week 3.  Your robot should stop when it gets within 100mm distance of the point (1200,-400), representing collision with an obstacle.

Use functions where appropriate to make your code managable and clear.

> A good function does one job, well.

You have all the pieces to do this already, stretching back to Week 1.  The task here is to assemble and test them.  A tidy structure with functions will make it easy to test and degug as you go.

Make your file a library called `ExerciseP2.py`, including a function called `main` that runs the simulation described.  Use the `if __name__` trick so that the simulation also runs if you invoke your file as a script.  _The template will help you with this._

> Use the script `test_P2.py` to test your library: running `test_p2.py` should run your simulation.
