    "Lists are a Python data type for storing sequences of data. Python lists are *ordered* - Each element in the list is associated with an index, starting from 0. Python lists are *mutable* - We can access and modify elements (or slices) of a list.  Python lists are *iterable* - we will commonly use a list by looping over (and processing) its elements. We may use nested lists to represent a matrix (or 2D grid). There are many built-in functions (len, enumate, in, and many more) that can help us work with lists. \n",
