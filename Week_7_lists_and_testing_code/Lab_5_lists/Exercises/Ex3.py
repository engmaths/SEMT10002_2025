================

Write some code that given a list of numbers will create a new list where each element 
is the cumulative sum of numbers in the first list. 

I.e if we have the list of numbers 
list_of_numbers = [1, 3, 6, 10], 
then our code should create a new list
cumulative_sum = [1, 4, 10, 16]
