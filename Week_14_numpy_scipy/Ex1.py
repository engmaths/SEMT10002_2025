2. Turn the 3x3 matrix into a 1x9 matrix.
3. Create a new 1x6 matrix by removing the first two and last elements of the 1x9 matrix.
4. Turn this 1x6 matrix into a 3x2 matrix.
5. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix

a b 
c d  
is given by the formula $determinant = ad-bc$. Write some code to find the determinant of the matrix:
