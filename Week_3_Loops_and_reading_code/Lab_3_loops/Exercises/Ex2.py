## Exercise 2 - Collatz Conjecture

Starting from any integer n, apply the rules: if even divide by 2, if odd multiply by 3 and add 1.
The Collatz conjecture states that if we follow this sequence, we will eventually reach one.
Although this problem looks simple, mathematicians are yet to prove it's true. 

We can use Python to explore this question numerically, seeing that at least for small number it seems to hold.

Write some code that counts the number of steps it takes a given starting number to reach one.
Then write some additional code to see which starting number under 1000 takes the most steps to reach 1.
