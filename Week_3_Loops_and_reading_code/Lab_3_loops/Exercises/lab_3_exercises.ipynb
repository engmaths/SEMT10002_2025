    "Before starting today's exercises, please spend 10 minutes to run through these comprehension checks with a partner. Each check contains a few line of Python code that you can run to get some output. Before running each piece of code, discuss with your partner what you think the output will be and why. Then run the code- is it what you expected? If not, why? Discuss with your partner, and TA if you are unsure."
