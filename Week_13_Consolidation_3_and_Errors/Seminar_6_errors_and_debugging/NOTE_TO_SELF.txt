Debug 1 - Code for summing numbers 1 to N.
Debug 2 - Code for averages

Example 1 is good, but somewhat confusing with e.g. errors in the actual test functions and the use of test functions themselves.
Example 2 is OK- good if students have written averages.py but not so good if not.

Recommendation for next year- Add Example 0 which is simple / easy to get them started.
