    "So far in this course, we've made extensive use of Python's built-in *list* data structure. A list can be used to store multiple values (of the same or different types), and many of the algorithms that we've implemented so far has worked by operating on lists. We've also seen some of Python's other built-in data structures, like *set*, which is like a list, but does not allow duplicate values, or the *dict*, in which each value is associated with a *key*, rather than an *index*, and a numpy *array*, in which all data must be of the same type (i.e all floats, or all 16 bit integers). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these data structures has certain advantages and disadvantages- for example, if we want to check whether a list of length N contains the value x, it'll take on average N *operations*, where as if we want to check whether a dictionary with N keys contains the key x, in the best case, it'll only take a single *operation*. If we're writing an algorithm that requires us to repeatedly check whether a value is in a data structure, it'll run much quicker if we use a dictionary rather than a list. "

By using a stack, we can do this relatively easily. The key idea is to start with an empty stack and then iterate over the string, adding each letter to the stack as we go. Once we've got to the end of string, we can then build a new string by popping each element of the stack we've made. As a stack is a LIFO data structure, the elements will come out in the reverse order. In code, we can do this by writing:"
