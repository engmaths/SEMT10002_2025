'''
Over the duration of this course, we're going to build a piece of code that can simulate the behaviour of two-wheeled mobile robot. 
To do this, we'll start by storing some information about our robot. In particular, i'd like to store: 

+ The robot's name (your choice).
+ The robot's size (let's assume a circle of radius 10 mm).
+ The distance between two robot's wheels (16 mm).
+ The robot's current position and orientation (x= 0 mm, y= 0 mm, angle= 0 mm).
+ The circumference of the robot's wheels (10 mm).

Create some variables to store this data in a Python script. 
If the robot turns both wheels for one entire revolution, it will move forward in a straight line, 
travelling a distance equal to the wheel circumference. 
Write some code to calculate the new position (i.e x and y) of our robot after it has moved.
