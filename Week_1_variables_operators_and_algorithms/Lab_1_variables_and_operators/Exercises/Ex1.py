## Exercise 1 - Binary to Decimal Conversion

We saw in the lecture notes that computers represent integers using a binary code.
We can convert from binary to decimals to remembering that each digit corresponds to a particular power of 2, 
and then summing up the values of each digit. In this exercise, you should write some code to:

1. Converting a binary "string" to a decimal number (Recall that, for example, `my_string[3]` will access the 4th character of the string variable)
2. Converting a decimal number into a binary string (You may want to use the modulo operator - `%` - to do this).

Start by writing code that solves only the examples given.  
Given time, try writing code that works for different input values.  
You can assume the same sizes as given.

#Binary to decimal conversion. Replace the '???' with your code.
binary_string = '1011'
decimal_value = '???'
print(decimal_value)

#Decimal to binary conversion. Replace the '???' with your code.
decimal_value2 = 13 
binary_string = '????'
print(binary_string)
