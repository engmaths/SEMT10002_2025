## Exercise 5 - Storing information about a robot

The images here (https://github.com/engmaths/SEMT10002_2025/blob/main/media/week_1/romi.jpg) and
https://github.com/engmaths/SEMT10002_2025/blob/main/media/week_1/Two-wheeled-differential-robot-kinematics.png
show a robot and a diagram labelling key parameters.  
You can find more about this model of robot [here](https://www.pololu.com/category/202/romi-chassis-and-accessories).

The robot has two wheels separated by a distance D. Each wheel has a radius r and turns at speed omega. 
The centre point of the robot is at co-ordinates (x, y) and has orientation theta.

To start with, we'll store some information about our robot. In particular, i'd like to store: 

+ The robot's name (your choice).
+ The robot's size (let's assume a circle of radius 160 mm).
+ The distance between two robot's wheels (150 mm).
+ The robot's current position and orientation (x= 0 mm, y= 0 mm, angle= 0 mm).
+ The radius of the robot's wheels (35 mm).

Create some variables to store this data in a Python script. 
Call your file "robot.py" and save it somewhere you'll remember as we'll return to this file in later weeks.

If the robot turns both wheels for one entire revolution, it will move forward in a straight line, travelling a distance equal to the wheel 
circumference. Write some code to calculate the new position (i.e x and y) of our robot after it has moved.
