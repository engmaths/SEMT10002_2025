At the University of CPA, we use the standard university grading scheme:

| Grade| Classification |
|------|------|
| 70+ | First |
| 60-70 | 2.1  |
| 50-60 | 2.2  |
| 40-50 | 3rd  |
| under 40 | Fail |

The "grade" used to calculate your classification is a weighted average of the marks for the two assigments- the first worth 20% and the second worth 80%. However, we also have an additional rule that you must achieve at least a passing mark (40%) in the second assignment to pass the course.

Write some code that uses Boolean expressions to determine the following students overall classification

| Student | Assignment 1| Assignment 2 |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------|
| Martin  | 100         | 35           |
| Arthur  | 40          | 65           |
| Hemma   | 25          | 80           |
| Josh    | 60          | 45           |
