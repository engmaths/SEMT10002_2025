## Exercise 2 - Binary to Decimal Conversion

We saw in the lecture notes that computers represent integers using a binary code. We can convert from binary to decimals to remembering that each digit corresponds to a particular power of 2, and then summing up the values of each digit. In this exercise, you should write some code to:

1. Converting a binary "string" to a decimal number
2. Converting a decimal number into a binary string (You may want to use the modulo operator - % - to do this).
3. Convert a fractional number into a binary string with a maximum length of 4 bits.
4. Calculate the error related to the conversion in 3.

#Binary to decimal conversion. Replace the '???' with your code.
binary_string = '1011'
decimal_value = '???'
print(decimal_value)

#Decimal to binary conversion. Replace the '???' with your code.
decimal_value2 = 13 
binary_string = '????'
print(binary_string) 

#Fraction to binary conversion and error calculated. Replace the '????' with your code.
fraction = 4.375
binary_string = '????'
error = '????'
print(binary_string)
print(error))
