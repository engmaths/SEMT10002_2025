Create a data strucure to store student grades 

| Student ID  | Name   | Year | Math | Science  | English  |
|-------------|--------|------|------|----------|----------|
| 1001        | Arthur | 10   | 85   | 90       | 88       |
| 1002        | Hemma  | 10   | 78   | 82       | 80       |
| 1003        | Josh   | 11   | 92   | 88       | 94       |
| 1004        | Martin | 11   | 92   | 88       | 94       |

Decide how to represent this data using tuples and dictionaries.
- Which parts of the data should be immutable (tuples)?
- Which parts should be mutable (dictionaries)?

There’s no one “right” answer — discuss your design decisions with the person next to you or your TA.

Your program should:
- Print the Science mark for Arthur.
- Add a new student, Saba, in Year 11 with marks (Math=81, Science=84, English=79).
- Update Josh’s English mark to 85.
- Print all student names and their average marks.
