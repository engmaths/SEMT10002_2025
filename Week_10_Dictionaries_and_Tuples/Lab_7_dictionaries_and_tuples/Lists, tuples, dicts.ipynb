    "To make this model a bit more useful, we'll need to add some extra cars. Your first task is to change the initialization code to assign cars to the road randomly. Concretely, your code should place a car at an index with probability $p$, where $p$ is a variable that defines how congested your road is. You will probably want to use the built-in Python function random.random(), which will generate a random number between 0 and 1 in your code.\n",
