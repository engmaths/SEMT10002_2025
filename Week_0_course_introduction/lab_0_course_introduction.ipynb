However, programming (and especially learning to program) can also be incredibly frustrating- often our code won't work and sometimes we'll get confusing error messages or see syntax we don't understand. This can then be compounded by the fact that some of our peers may not seem to be struggling at all (i.e someone may have done A level Computing, or self-taught themselves as a hobby). Unfortunately, every year, we see students decide that programming \"just isn't for them\".

    "**Exercise:** Using these commands, make a new directory called \"CPA\", with a subdirectory called \"Week 0\" inside it. Inside \"Week 0\", create an empty file called \"Exercise 1.py\"\n",
    "When completing this exercise, notice how the *cd* command handles directory and file names with a space in them. The *cd* command interprets a name containing a space as two separate names. You can get around this by using quotation marks, e.g. ```cd \"Week 0\"```. However, it's good practice to avoid using spaces in the directory names- using a dash(-) or an underscore(\\_) to represent spaces instead. \n",
