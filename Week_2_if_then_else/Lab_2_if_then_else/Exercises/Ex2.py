## Exercise 2 - Circles

Suppose we have three circles in the $xy$-plane:

- Circle $C_1$ is centred at $(0, 0)$ with radius of length 5.
- Circle $C_2$ is centred at $(2, 1)$ and has radius of length 2.
- Circle $C_3$ is centred at $(-5, 0)$ and has a radius of length 3.

The image here (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engmaths/SEMT10002_2025/refs/heads/main/media/week_2/circles.png) illustrates the arrangement.

> Using conditional statements, write a program which takes in the variables $x$ and $y$ and tells the user which circle(s) the point $(x, y)$ is in.

> Think about the order in which your program evaluates the expressions? Is this the most efficient way to structure the code?
