Exercise 3
================

1. Import the file xyz_data.csv 

2. Print the (x,y,z) coordinates of each row in the file

3. Compute the distance, d, to each point from the previous point
(for the first point compute the distance from (0,0,0))

4. Save the results into a new CSV file called results.csv with columns: x, y, z, magnitude

5. Modify your code to read the file name passed as a command-line argument. 
Include a check that avoids the program exiting with an error if no command line arguments 
or the incorrect number of command line arguments are passed.
