    "_eg_ in **Week 3**, when we looked at loops, there's a fairly good chance that you'll need to use loops to solve the exercises. \n",

    "As the old adage goes, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consolidation exercises are also a chance for you to write slightly longer pieces of code than we'll generally have time to do in the lab. \n",

    "You have hopefully also noticed that there's no pre-learning materials or comprehension checks for this week; the flip-side of that is that we expect you to spend slightly more time (a few hours) working on these problems that you would a regular lab sheet. \n",
    "Consolidation exercises are also much closer to what we would expect you to complete for your individual programming project (**worth 80% of your mark** in this course) and so represent the best chance for you to \"practice\" the coursework before you complete it. \n",
    "As such, we'll be providing both formative and peer feedback for consolidation exercises submitted on *Blackboard*."
