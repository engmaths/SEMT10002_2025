    "This week, we'll be doing our very first *consolidation* exercise. In prior weeks, we've been looking at specific elements of Python syntax. This is necessary, but has the drawback that when you're solving the exercises, you're given a big clue about what you should do- e.g. in week 3, when we looked at loops, there's a fairly good chance that you'll need to use loops to solve the exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of consolidation exercises is to give you practice writing code in a scenario that is closer to what you'll face after this course, where it won't always be immediately obvious how a piece of code should be written. This practice will be invaluable after the course when your programming *in the wild*, but at first you may find it hard to get started- given such a big problem, what should you do first? My advice is to start by simplifying the problem and building your solution up bit-by-bit. As the old adage goes, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time!\n",

    "You have hopefully also noticed that there's no pre-learning materials or comprehension checks for this week; the flip-side of that is that we expect you to spend slightly more time (a few hours) working on these problems that you would a regular lab sheet. Consolidation exercises are also much closer to what we would expect you to complete for your individual programming project (worth 80% of your mark in this course) and so represent the best chance for you to \"practice\" the coursework before you complete it. As such, we'll be providing both formative and peer feedback for consolidation exercises submitted on Blackboard."
