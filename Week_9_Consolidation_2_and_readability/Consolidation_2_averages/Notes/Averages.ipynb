    "This week, we'll be doing our second **consolidation** exercise. As a reminder, our aim here is to give you a less structured exercise, closer to what you'll face after this course, and as preparation for the summative assessment at the end of the course. Before diving in and writing code, you should think carefully about how you can break the larger task down into smaller chunks, and how you can use functions to structure and organise your code. As before, we'll provide formative feedback for work submitted via Blackboard. The due date date for this submission is 29th November at 5pm. \n"
