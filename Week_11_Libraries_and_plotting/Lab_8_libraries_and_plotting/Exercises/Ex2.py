Exercise 2
================

The number of cyclists crossing a bridge at hourly intervals during a 24 hour period was recorded every day for 1 year.

The data recorded during each 1 hour interval throughout the day was averaged for all days of the year.

The data shows the number of cyclist travelling:
    - east
    - west
    - in total

Import this data from `hourly_cycle_count_weekend.csv`.

Create a scatter plot of the three sets of data, with 'Time' on the horizontal axis and 'Number of cyclists' on the vertical axis.
