Exercise 4
================


During the Covid-19 pandemic, a city recorded the number of infected individuals for one year. 
You are going to plot the raw data showing a time series of the number of infected individuals, and on the same axes 
plot a logistic growth curve to observe whether if fits the raw data.
Whereas exponential population growth shows rapid population growth if resources were not a factor.
Logistic population growth models population growth and the decrease of the growth as the population meets the 
carrying capacity or sustainable resource limit.


1. Import data about the city from 'city_info.csv'

2. Import time series data about number of infected individuals from 'infection_data.csv'

3. Use the data in 'infection_data.csv' to plot the raw data on the fraction of the population infected at each timesetp as a scatter plot. 

4. Plot the logistic growth curve $f(t)$ where $f$ is the fraction of the population that has been infected at time $t$, using parameters from 'city_info.csv', for all timesteps $t$ in 'infection_data.csv'

For both the logistic growth curve and the raw data, remember to normalise the data on number of infected individuals to be a fraction of the totoal population
